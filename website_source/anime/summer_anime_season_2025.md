This season has a lot of shows that are getting a second season. There are also plenty of shows that
are still new and unique to warrant watching as well. I am really excited for this summer season way
more than I have been for previous summers. This is actually the first summer season I'm actually
watching most of the shows being aired.

[Silent Witch: Chinmoku no Majo no Kakushigoto/ Secrets of the Silent Witch](https://myanimelist.net/anime/59459/Silent_Witch__Chinmoku_no_Majo_no_Kakushigoto)

This show is really funny to me. I appreciate the Nice villainess Isabell Norton, the kinda creepy but somewhat lovable
Louis Miller, Miss Monica Everett's familiar Nero and the rest of the cast on this show. Monica Everett is played up as
as bocchi like character, but I think this cast does enough to differentiate themselves from other main character
hitori-bochi shows.

[Food Court de, Mata Ashita./ See You Tomorrow at the Food Court](https://myanimelist.net/anime/60508/Food_Court_de_Mata_Ashita)

I am a little sad that this show is only 6 episodes rather than the full 12 episodes most shows are for a typical season.
I like the dynamic between the gatcha obsessed Wada and her straight woman Yamamoto. They do a really nice job of keeping up
with one another while still being interesting and hilarious.

[Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku/ The Fragrant Flower Blooms with Dignity](https://myanimelist.net/anime/59845/Kaoru_Hana_wa_Rin_to_Saku)

This is one of the few shows I have watched, where I have also read a lot of the manga for so the show has been going like how I
expected it to. The Romeo and Juliet theming is really overt, but I enjoyed the manga for 130 chapters so far and I see myself
also watching this show till the end of the season. I really like the journey that both Rintarou and Waguri go on in the story.

[Yofukashi no Uta Season 2/ Call of the Night Season 2](https://myanimelist.net/anime/58390/Yofukashi_no_Uta_Season_2)

I recently started watching some of Season 1 of this show to see why I got interested. So far, season 2 has blown season 1 out of the park,
becuase Kou really was not as compelling as the rest of the cast in Season 1. In season 2 however, I like Kou's character so much more
and I feel like everyone is a lot more interesting, especially finding more about Nazuna. Like how she is a 40 year old woman and her
history with Honda in the hospital. I look forward to how this show continues to change, Creepy Nuts awesome songs, and how the
detective will continue to mess with the vampires plans.

[Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru Season 2/ My Dress-Up Darling Season 2](https://myanimelist.net/anime/53065/Sono_Bisque_Doll_wa_Koi_wo_Suru_Season_2)

I really like this show's second season so far compared to its first. Gojo Wakana is still a little clueless when it comes to friends and
how he should deal with group situations, but his classmates and Marin are accepting of him and are giving him plenty of space to grow.
Just like in the episode that came out today. He and Marin had a misunderstanding when it comes to how much time Gojou would have to make the
Seijo-samma cosplay and his class had his back. They did not expect Gojou to both work on the class and the outfit. The animation is also on
another level with how much detail they give to recreating the anime within this anime. I kinda want them to become real shows, becuase they honestly
look better than a lot of the shows I have watched in the past.

[Bad Girl](https://myanimelist.net/anime/59161/Bad_Girl)


[Futari Solo Camp/ Solo Camping for Two](https://myanimelist.net/anime/60665/Futari_Solo_Camp)

This show is a whoolesome romcom between an introverted otaku solo camper and a "pushy" woman who
want to learn how to camp by herself. I was recently rewatching some of Yuru camp Season one
and I am getting some serious Rin and Nadeshiko vibes from the the two mcs.
