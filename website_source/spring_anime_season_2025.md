Here are my thoughts about the shows I watched during the Spring 2025 season.

This list is mainly for me. I watch a lot of [anime](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/jusan0?status=2) and I want to start 
documenting my thoughts about not only current season's but also some past 
anime season's I've watched.

(Write an overveiw of how I felt about them and maybe some interesting points)

[Aru Majo ga Shinu Made/ Once Upon a Witch's Death](https://myanimelist.net/anime/59169/Aru_Majo_ga_Shinu_Made)

This was a standout show for me. I did not really have any expectations going 
into this show, since I had not read the manga or heard anything about the 
show. The first episode drew me in and I really enjoyed the story about how
Meg Raspberry made some new friends and learned about an old seemingly 
forgot type of magic.

[Hibi wa Sugiredo Meshi Umashi/ Food for the Soul](https://myanimelist.net/anime/60658/Hibi_wa_Sugiredo_Meshi_Umashi)

I am a sucker for [CGDCT](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteGirlsDoingCuteThings) anime
and this show did not disappoint.

[Zatsu Tabi: That's Journey](https://myanimelist.net/anime/55514/Zatsu_Tabi__Thats_Journey)

I thought this show was just going to be another CGDCT show, see Food for the Soul for an explation,
but I was really suprised by how I enjoyed the Journey of Chika Suzugamori as
she was learning to grow as a new manga artist. She starts the searis is a rut
just after winning a New Author manga contest and has to figure out what to do now
with her new career. As the series goes on, Chika learns that she has just what
she needs to make a new series, but also to find new inspirations for her own
work.

[Ninja to Koroshiya no Futarigurashi/ A Ninja and an Assassin Under One Roof](https://myanimelist.net/anime/58725/Ninja_to_Koroshiya_no_Futarigurashi)

I have a lot of thoughts about this show. I really enjoyed the banter between
the two main characters and I think there was a lot more depth to this show than
I first relized. The undertones of Neurodivergency between the main cast was 
subtle to me at first, but I picked up on it as the series continued. It was
a light-hearted show and would reccomend to anyone who just wants a fun but 
mostly-lighthearted commedy to watch.

[Apocalypse Hotel](https://myanimelist.net/anime/59675/Apocalypse_Hotel)

I really liked the light-hearted and obsurd jabs that got sent to Yachi Yo and
the rest of the robots at the hotel. My favorite episode was the Wedding-funeral
for the Tanuki's. 


[Witch Watch](https://myanimelist.net/anime/59597/Witch_Watch)

This shonen was a nice additions to the limit amount I have watched. The show
has a nice balence between letting the world almost reset for some episodes, 
while still pushing the world forward with the narrative. 


[Tu Bian Yingxiong X/ To Be Hero X](https://myanimelist.net/anime/53447/Tu_Bian_Yingxiong_X)

I really like how this show contantly changes styles and I almost never know
what to expect from it. It is charming at times. I like basically the whole cast.
I didn't think Ghostface would get his own episode. I like how they play with the
world.

[Kusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season/ The Apothecary Diaries Season 2](https://myanimelist.net/anime/58514/Kusuriya_no_Hitorigoto_2nd_Season)

I really liked the second season of the show. It continued to expand the world
in an interesting way and gave more context as to why I love this show. Maomao is
a really interesting character and female lead. I do not know how I feel about 
her dynamic with Jinshi. At first I really hated the love interest between them
because of how ignorant Jinshi is to the life of a 'normal or poor' person in 
their universe. But as the show continues, he does try to learn and respect
that Maomao does not really want to be with anyone currently. 

Shows I watched, but do not have any thoughts about them currently
